FSharp-Mining-the-Social-Web
============================

I am glad that I attended the [Data Scince Nashville Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Nashville/), [Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+,and More](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Nashville/events/158475452/) lecture by [Matthew A. Russell](https://twitter.com/ptwobrussell). Matthew talked about his [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030195.do) which is about acquiring, analyzing, and summarizing the social webs like Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and so on. He also answered a lot of questions about his career in Data Science.

I also like how he explained the Data Science field with this Venn Diagram.

The book recommends Python and (very cool) [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). You can find the book material and Python code here https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition.


However, I am learning F# and would like to learn more about Data Science, so I think it would be great to implement the code from the book using F# instead :-).

Learn more about using F# for Data Science at [Using F# for Data Science](http://fsharp.org/data-science/) at [The F# Software Foundation site](http://fsharp.org/)

Let's start with [Mining Twitter](https://github.com/kimsk/FSharp-Mining-the-Social-Web/tree/master/src/Twitter)
