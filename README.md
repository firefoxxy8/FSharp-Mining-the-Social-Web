FSharp-Mining-the-Social-Web
============================

I am glad that I attended the [Data Scince Nashville Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Nashville/), [Mining the Social Web: Data Mining Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+,and More](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Nashville/events/158475452/) by [Matthew A. Russell](https://twitter.com/ptwobrussell). The book recommends Python and (very cool) [iPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/tree/master/ipynb/). You can find the book material and Python code here https://github.com/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition.


But I am learning F# and would like to learn more about Data Science, so I am going to implement the code in Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly, 2013) using F# instead :-).

Let's start with [Mining Twitter](https://github.com/kimsk/FSharp-Mining-the-Social-Web/tree/master/src/Twitter)
